                <p>For a more complete webpage, visit <a href="https://jerekyyro.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>
                <p>You will find my official university weppage from <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/people/jere-kyyro">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Currently I am working as University teacher in the Study of Cultures at he University of Turku. I teach methodology and working-life related courses to the students of ethnology, folkloristics and study of religion.</p>
                <p>I am also affiliated with LegitRel research project, led by Assistant Professor Titus Hjelm (University of Helsinki) and funded by the Academy of Finland that analyzes the connections of Finnish party politics and religion. (https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/religion-politics-and-legitimation.)</p>
                <p>Between March and July 2020 I conducted an evaluation study of the interdisciplinary operating model of the Centre for Education and Research on Social and Health Services, University of Turku.</p>
                <p>PhD Thesis: Mannerheim and changing interpretations: Mediatized Civil Religion in the Cultural Controversies of the 2000s and 2010s.</p>
                <p>I defended my PhD thesis in Study of Religion in February 2019. It deals with Finnish art controversies in the 2000s and 2010s that concern the figure of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1867-1951), Marshall of Finland during World War II, commander of the Whites in Finnish 1918 Civil War, winner of the Greatest Finn competition in 2004, and who has also been called The High Priest of “Home, Religion and Fatherland” (slogan of Finnish right-wing nationalism).</p>
                <p>I am interested in the effects of the organization of the field of cultural production, and especially the media (public broadcasting company Yle and commercial media), and the tensions and struggles on this fields to  the new kind of prominence of national symbols. I approach my cases using an post-Durkheimian and Critical-Study-of-Religion-influenced adaptation of the concept of  Civil Religion, and an adaptation of Bourdieuan field theory, influenced by the work of such media scholars as Nick Couldry, Johanna Sumiala and Stig Hjarvard.</p>
